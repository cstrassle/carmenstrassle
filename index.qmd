Hi! I'm an incoming Economics Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I am currently a [Predoctoral Research Fellow at SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/predoctoral-research-fellowship-opportunities) where I work with Professor [Neale Mahoney](https://nmahoney.people.stanford.edu/) on the financial and mental health effects of medical debt relief. 

Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow for [Heidi Williams](https://sites.google.com/view/heidi-l-williams/home) where I researched metascience. 

I graduated from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/) where I studied economics and math. In my free time I powerlift.

I'm broadly interested in topics of IO and public economics.

[My C.V. is available here.](/zahra_thabet_cv.pdf) (and my CV template can be found [here](https://gabesekeres.com/cv.html))
