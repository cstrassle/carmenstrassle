I'm an incoming [Predoctoral Research Fellow at SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/predoctoral-research-fellowship-opportunities) where I work for Professor [Heidi Williams](https://heidi-williams.humsci.stanford.edu/). Previously, I was an undegraduate at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/) where I studied economics and math. In my free time I powerlift.
