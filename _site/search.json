I started applying to predocs in mid-September. I talked to current and former predocs through the end of September. I did my first coding task at the end of September, and I made my decision during the first half of October.\n\nSIEPR stipend (which is the same for all predocs)\n\n2024-2025: 61k, 2023-2024: 58.5k, 2022-2023: 55k\nThe stipend is deposited quarterly – the beginning of work was in early July but most people in my cohort were paid for the first time on July 30th.\nI spent 1.05k on rent last year and now am spending 2.1k this year.\n\nHealth insurance with SIEPR covering the premium.

In the last year of my predoc, I met with my PI at least once, often more times per week and corresponded over email with him almost daily. My project management and econometric skills have vastly improved.\nI found balancing classes with work to be incredibly difficult — much more difficult than I thought it would be — I didn’t have time outside of work and classes to do anything or work on my own ideas, and often felt like I didn’t have enough time to fully appreciate what I was being taught in the courses. Going to class was also disruptive to my workflow. I didn’t walk away with nothing; having the opportunity to take convex optimization with the professor who invented most of the field was particularly helpful in appraoching my PhD. Courses can also be useful for predocs who feel they lack sufficient math/core econ, but that was not my situation. In the end, when I didn’t take courses in my second year, I felt much better applying to PhD applications, maintaining personal relationships, hobbies, etc.\nI ended up staying at Stanford for my PhD and I’m very happy with the level of support and mentorship that I have going into the PhD."

Some are more explicit than others with respect to expected classes etc.\nAlex Albright’s Thesis Advice\nTalk to professors at your university; tell them that you are interested in pursuing a PhD in economics after you graduate.

    "text": "Applying to Economics PhDs\nI applied to PhD programs in Economics this past year (2023-2024). Here are a couple of pieces of advice that I have.\n\nAdvice I found online on how to approach the personal statement is contradictory at best. Don’t get too bogged down in this – talk to your recommenders and see what they think is the best approach for you.\nHave as many people as possible read your application materials as soon as possible.\nHave a way of tracking deadlines both for yourself and for your recommenders. I used google sheets with the following rows. I shared a version of this spreadsheet with each recommender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave I invited recommender\nRecommender submitted\nSubmission Deadline\nProgram\n\n\n\n\nyes\nno\nNovember 29th\nUniversity X Economics PhD\n\n\n\n\nApply to fee waivers for the GRE and for individual universities if you are eligible. A lot of places require that you do this in advance. When I was applying, I didn’t feel like I had enough time to apply to most waivers because I didn’t think about it until I was ready to submit. Here is a breakdown of my costs (I applied to 23 programs in the US and the UK across econ, finance, and public policy). The GRE costs are high because I retook it, and paid to move the date when I didn’t feel prepared. The average application fee was around $85, and I received fee waivers for 3 programs.\nHere are my costs by category:\n\n\n\nApply to fellowships if you are eligible for them. They can help boost your application and provide you with better conditions as a PhD student. A couple that I can think of off the top of my head:\n\nNSF GRFP (US citizens, nationals, or permanent residents)\nPD Soros\nUniCredit\nSearch your country of origin + national bank + economics phd fellowship\nSearch your undergraduate institution + graduate fellowships (for undergraduates)\n\nif your undergraduate institution has a fellowship office it might be useful to meet with them as well.\n\nConsider applying to institution specific fellowships\n\nRhodes / Marshall / Fullbright, but those are only usable at certain UK institutions. These all have early deadlines.\nKnight-Hennessy at Stanford\n\n\nCompilation of other people’s advice ### My Setup\nThings I use everyday\n\nGitHub to implement version control with your code.\nChatGPT for troubleshooting code, writing Tikz diagrams, etc etc. (And GitHub CoPilot, which is free for students, for in-line code suggestions).\nIf you use Overleaf set up Dropbox integration.\n\nI prefer Texifier (better UI). Can edit documents through Dropbox so it also updates on Overleaf.\n\nZotero for citation management.\nGoodNotes (enable some kind of syncing so you don’t risk losing your notes)\nI prefer the simplicity of Obsidian over Notion\nLibby (app). Borrow free audiobooks from your library! Really nice UI.\n\nPortable ergonomic equipment (good for hand/arm pain)\n\nNextstand (h/t Nic)\nMicrosoft Sculpt or Kyria\nLogitech MX Master 3"

    "text": "Hi! Thanks for visiting my site. I’ve tried to compile some resources for students interested in pursuing economics as a predoc in my resources page. Here, I’ll talk a little bit about myself.\nI’m a PhD student at Stanford. When I’m not working, I bird- mushroom- plant- etc.- watch and appreciate the biodiversity of California! I also powerlift (which I’ve been doing on and off for the past four years). I also donate blood with the Stanford Blood Center as often as I am eligible and would encourage anyone who is eligible to consider doing so as well. Being a consistent donor can be especially helpful for patients who receive frequent blood transfusions and need a good match on antibodies outside of (A, B, O, Rh +/-).\nI attended Wellesley College, a historically women’s college, where I majored in economics and math. Before I became an economist, I interned at NASA for two summers and got to see a lot of cool things, like the James Webb Space Telescope before it went into space. I also got to work with Wellesley’s 171-year-old telescope, and hope I can find time to pick up recreational astronomy again in the future. Many government agencies have internship programs for high school and college students (that aren’t publicized that well), so if you’re interested in working in the public sector, I’d encourage you to check them out, like NASA’s program here."
