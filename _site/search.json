    "text": "Smarter people have already said a lot of what I think needs to be said. I’ve included a ton of links + some original advice below.\n\nEconRA Guide: Covers all steps of the pre-doc process. Highly recommend reading through.\nAlvin Christian’s Advice: Advice from a recent predoc.\nWomen in Econ and Policy Pre-Doc Advice Compilation\nPredoc.org: You might’ve heard of this. I used it mostly to look for jobs. They host coding and other kinds of workshops that can be helpful.\nPredoc survey: Useful statistics.\nThe predoc discourse part 1, 2, 3, 4, anon predoc, 6 (these are only some tweets that I found looking back)\n\nPeriodically on Twitter, economics professors and former pre-docs talk about the pros and cons of predocs. These perspectives are really valuable and often not captured in the websites above.\nI went into the process aware of this and it prompted me to be very thorough about the actual work environment of the places I was considering.\n\nTalk to previous pre-docs of the person who you want to work for and ask about work hours, expectations, stress, & general environment.\n\nHow many hours a week did they work on average?\nHow reasonable did they feel like the deadlines were?\nHow often did they meet with their PI to talk about their own research ideas, professional growth etc.?\nHow collaborative was their pre-doc cohort?\nWhat is their physical office like? Are there windows? How often are they expected to work in person versus remote?\nHow is the salary / stipend structured? Were they paid on time? How much of their stipend did they spend on rent?\nWhat is health insurance like? Do they have to cover the premium?\nWhat opportunities do they have to take graduate-level classes during their pre-doc? Do they have to cover the cost? Is it for a grade or can they only audit?\nWhat are the norms around co-authorship with pre-docs? How will your work be recognized?\n\nThe norms within econ don’t match up with other fields. In some fields, it is the norm for RAs who contribute a significant amount of time to a project to become co-authors. In econ, this view is often discounted in favor of pre-docs remaining in the acknowledgements. Here are some interesting discussions of this phenomenon: 1, 2\n\nAsk if any of their friends have had a particularly good experience with certain professors.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredoc.org and its Twitter\nNBER (be sure to check both opportunities at the NBER and outside of it)\nEcon RA twitter\n\nSometimes this account is a little delayed in retweeting things, I would just search @econ_ra on Twitter to see opportunities that @ them.\n\nEcon Job Market usually skews towards more international positions.\nFed Econ Jobs it’s surprisingly hard to find this website on google, but it contains a lot of good information if you are interested in RA-ing at the Fed.\nThere are certain programs that regularly hire some RAs. Here are a couple:\n\nSIEPR\nTobin (Yale)\nInnovations for Poverty Action\nJ-PAL\nMicrosoft Research New England\nNYU Stern\nColumbia Business School\nStanford GSB\nEPIC UChicago\nBecker Friedman Institute\nKellog\nHarvard Business School\nFama Miller\nChicago Booth\nOpportunity Insights\nKing Center, Stanford\nCouncil of Economic Advisers\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nDOJ Antitrust\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted this is a domain I’m a little less familiar with, bridge programs emphasize research, mentoring, and academic work in equal parts. Like pre-docs, they are usually two years long. Here are a couple:\n\nColumbia Bridge to PhD\nMichicagn Bridge to PhD\n\n\n\n\nA little info on my timeline: I started applying to pre-docs in mid-September. I talked to current and former pre-docs through the end of September. I did my first coding task at the end of September, and I made my decision during the first half of October.\nHopefully, once I start, I’ll post more about my actual experience (maybe do one of those day in the life videos?). I’ll also try to be transparent about costs of living etc. since that is usually a part of pre-docs that I haven’t seen talked about that much.\nAt SIEPR my benefits are as follows. Granted I have not actually started, this is my understanding of the benefits when I accepted the job offer.\n\nStipend > 52k\n\nFor context, my housing costs will likely be between 1-2.5k per month for me living with my partner within biking distance of campus which we will then split. Off-campus co-ops, some on-campus housing, living further away from campus, and sharing a house with many roommates lowers the costs. I plan on using a bike as a main method of transit.\n\nHealth insurance with SIEPR covering the premium.\nOne grad course per quarter covered by SIEPR (excluding summer) taken for a grade.\nLaptop\nAccess to on campus housing (besides the first summer if you are coming straight from undergrad)\nAccess to on campus amenities like libraries, gym etc.\nMentoring\nPre-doc programming (unsure what this will look like)\nAbility to switch mentors if it’s not working out.\n20 leave days and 10 holidays. Leave days are not guaranteed but negotiated with professor.\nJ-1 visa sponsorship / OPT eligible (I am not international, so I know less about how this works in practice)"
