I am currently a Predoctoral Research Fellow at SIEPR where I work with Professor Neale Mahoney on the financial and mental health effects of medical debt relief.\nPreviously, I was a predoctoral fellow for Heidi Williams where I researched metascience.\nI graduated from Wellesley College where I studied economics and math. In my free time I powerlift.\nI’m broadly interested in topics of IO and public economics.\nMy C.V. is available here. (and my CV template can be found here)"

    "text": "Hi! Thanks for visiting my site. I’ve tried to compile some resources for students interested in pursuing economics as a predoc in my resources page. Here, I’ll talk a little bit about myself.\nI’m a predoc at Stanford, where I’m working on a medical debt relief project with Neale Mahoney. I’m interested in health economics, public finance, and household finance.\nWhen I’m not working, I powerlift (which I’ve been doing on and off for the past three years). I also donate blood with the Stanford Blood Center as often as I am eligible and would encourage anyone who is eligible to consider doing so as well. Being a consistent donor can be especially helpful for patients who receive frequent blood transfusions and need a good match on antibodies outside of (A, B, O, Rh +/-).\nI attended Wellesley College, a historically women’s college, where I majored in economics and math. Before I became an economist, I interned at NASA for two summers and got to see a lot of cool things, like the James Webb Space Telescope before it went into space. I also got to work with Wellesley’s 171-year-old telescope, and hope I can find time to pick up recreational astronomy again in the future. Many government agencies have internship programs for high school and college students (that aren’t publicized that well), so if you’re interested in working in the public sector, I’d encourage you to check them out, like NASA’s program here."

    "text": "Smarter people have already said a lot of what I think needs to be said. I’ve included a ton of links + some original advice below.\n\nEconRA Guide: Covers all steps of the predoc process. Highly recommend reading through.\nAlvin Christian’s Advice: Advice from a recent predoc.\nWomen in Econ and Policy Pre-Doc Advice Compilation\nPredoc.org: You might’ve heard of this. I used it mostly to look for jobs. They host coding and other kinds of workshops that can be helpful.\nPredoc survey: Useful statistics on the industry\nTalk to previous predocs of the person who you want to work for and ask about work hours, expectations, stress, & general environment.\n\nWhat graduate programs did the previous predocs end up in? Only take a position where you would be happy with the median placement of all former predocs.\nHow many hours a week did they work on average?\nHow reasonable did they feel like the deadlines were?\nHow often did they meet with their PI to talk about their own research ideas, professional growth etc.?\nIs there any predoc cohort / how much interaction do they have with other predocs at the institution?\nWhat is their physical office like? Are there windows? How often are they expected to work in person versus remote?\nHow is the salary / stipend structured? Were they paid on time? How much of their stipend did they spend on rent?\nWhat is health insurance like? Who covers the premium?\nWhat opportunities do they have to take graduate-level classes during their predoc? Do they have to cover the cost? Is it for a grade or can they only audit?\nWhat are the norms around co-authorship with predocs? How will your work be recognized?\n\nThe norms within econ don’t match up with other fields. In some fields, it is the norm for RAs who contribute a significant amount of time to a project to become co-authors. In econ, this view is often discounted in favor of predocs remaining in the acknowledgements. Here are some interesting discussions of this phenomenon: 1, 2\n\nAsk if any of their friends have had a particularly good or bad experiences with certain professors.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredoc.org and its Twitter\nNBER (be sure to check both opportunities at the NBER and outside of it)\nEcon RA twitter\n\nSometimes this account is a little delayed in retweeting things, I would just search @econ_ra on Twitter to see opportunities that @ them.\n\nEcon Job Market usually skews towards more international positions.\nFed Econ Jobs it’s surprisingly hard to find this website on google, but it contains a lot of good information if you are interested in RA-ing at the Fed.\nThere are certain programs that regularly hire some RAs. Here are a couple:\n\nPhD Excellence Initiative\nSIEPR (Stanford)\nTobin (Yale)\nInnovations for Poverty Action\nJ-PAL\nMicrosoft Research New England\nNYU Stern\nColumbia Business School\nStanford GSB\nEPIC UChicago\nBecker Friedman Institute\nKellogg\nHarvard Business School\nFama Miller\nChicago Booth\nOpportunity Insights\nKing Center, Stanford\nCouncil of Economic Advisers\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nDOJ Antitrust\nColumbia Bridge to PhD\nMichigan Bridge to PhD\n\n\n\n\n\nA little info on my timeline (I applied in the fall of 2021). I started applying to predocs in mid-September. I talked to current and former predocs through the end of September. I did my first coding task at the end of September, and I made my decision during the first half of October.\n\nStipend 58.5k\n\nThe stipend is deposited quarterly – the beginning of work was in early July but most people in my cohort were paid for the first time on July 30th.\nI spent 1.05k on rent last year and now am spending 2.1k this year.\n\nHealth insurance with SIEPR covering the premium. I find that I dont pay more than $20 for routine services and $100 for ER services. There is a hospital on campus which is nice.\nOne grad course per quarter at Stanford covered by SIEPR (excluding summer).\nWork laptop\nAccess to on campus housing\n\nIn practice, this isn’t quite correct; no predocs in my cohort got fall housing on-campus through Stanford’s lottery. I would say for myself, one of the more stressful parts of the job is getting housing/ moving multiple times within a year and not really knowing that this would happen beforehand.\n\nAccess to on campus amenities like libraries, gym etc.\nMentoring\nPredoc programming\n20 leave days and 10 holidays. Leave days are not guaranteed but negotiated with professor.\nJ-1 visa sponsorship / OPT eligible (I am not an international predoc, so I know less about how this works in practice)"

Some are more explicit than others with respect to expected classes etc.\nAlex Albright’s Thesis Advice\nTalk to professors at your university; tell them that you are interested in pursuing a PhD in economics after you graduate. Ask what they think you should do to be best positioned to achieve that goal.\n\n\nMy Setup\n\nThings I use everyday\n\nGitHub to implement version control with your code.\nChatGPT for troubleshooting code, writing Tikz diagrams, etc etc . (And GitHub CoPilot, which is free for students, for in-line code suggestions).\nIf you use Overleaf set up Dropbox integration.\n\nI prefer Texifier (better UI). Can edit documents through Dropbox so it also updates on Overleaf.\n\nZotero for citation management.\nGoodNotes (enable some kind of syncing so you don’t risk losing your notes)\nI prefer the simplicity of Obsidian over Notion\nLibby (app). Borrow free audiobooks from your library! Really nice UI.\n\nPortable ergonomic equipment (good for hand/arm pain)\n\nNextstand (h/t Nic)\nMicrosoft Sculpt or Kyria\nLogitech MX Master 3"
