    "text": "Smarter people have already said a lot of what I think needs to be said. I’ve included a ton of links + some original advice below.\n\nEconRA Guide: Covers all steps of the pre-doc process. Highly recommend reading through.\nAlvin Christian’s Advice: Advice from a recent predoc.\nWomen in Econ and Policy Pre-Doc Advice Compilation\nPredoc.org: You might’ve heard of this. I used it mostly to look for jobs. They host coding and other kinds of workshops that can be helpful.\nPredoc survey: Useful statistics on the industry\nThe predoc discourse part 1, 2, 3, 4, anon predoc (these are only some tweets that I found looking back)\n\nPeriodically on Twitter, economics professors and former pre-docs talk about the pros and cons of predocs. These perspectives are really valuable and often not captured in the websites above.\nI went into the process aware of this and it prompted me to be very thorough about the actual work environment of the places I was considering.\n\nTalk to previous pre-docs of the person who you want to work for and ask about work hours, expectations, stress, & general environment.\n\nHow many hours a week did they work on average?\nHow reasonable did they feel like the deadlines were?\nHow often did they meet with their PI to talk about their own research ideas, professional growth etc.?\nIs there any pre-doc cohort / how much interaction do they have with other predocs at the institution?\nWhat is their physical office like? Are there windows? How often are they expected to work in person versus remote?\nHow is the salary / stipend structured? Were they paid on time? How much of their stipend did they spend on rent?\nWhat is health insurance like? Who Covers the premium?\nWhat opportunities do they have to take graduate-level classes during their pre-doc? Do they have to cover the cost? Is it for a grade or can they only audit?\nWhat are the norms around co-authorship with pre-docs? How will your work be recognized?\n\nThe norms within econ don’t match up with other fields. In some fields, it is the norm for RAs who contribute a significant amount of time to a project to become co-authors. In econ, this view is often discounted in favor of pre-docs remaining in the acknowledgements. Here are some interesting discussions of this phenomenon: 1, 2\n\nAsk if any of their friends have had a particularly good or bad experiences with certain professors.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredoc.org and its Twitter\nNBER (be sure to check both opportunities at the NBER and outside of it)\nEcon RA twitter\n\nSometimes this account is a little delayed in retweeting things, I would just search @econ_ra on Twitter to see opportunities that @ them.\n\nEcon Job Market usually skews towards more international positions.\nFed Econ Jobs it’s surprisingly hard to find this website on google, but it contains a lot of good information if you are interested in RA-ing at the Fed.\nThere are certain programs that regularly hire some RAs. Here are a couple:\n\nSIEPR\nTobin (Yale)\nInnovations for Poverty Action\nJ-PAL\nMicrosoft Research New England\nNYU Stern\nColumbia Business School\nStanford GSB\nEPIC UChicago\nBecker Friedman Institute\nKellog\nHarvard Business School\nFama Miller\nChicago Booth\nOpportunity Insights\nKing Center, Stanford\nCouncil of Economic Advisers\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nDOJ Antitrust\nColumbia Bridge to PhD\nMichigan Bridge to PhD\n\n\n\n\n\nA little info on my timeline: I started applying to pre-docs in mid-September. I talked to current and former pre-docs through the end of September. I did my first coding task at the end of September, and I made my decision during the first half of October.\n\nStipend 55k\n\nThe stipend is deposited quarterly – the beginning of work was in early July but most people in my cohort were paid for the first time on July 30th.\nI spend 1.6k on rent per month but I’m moving in the fall and will likely have to spend more.\n\nHealth insurance with SIEPR covering the premium. Insurance is ok – relative to my undergrad insurance I pay slightly more for medical services. There is a hospital on campus which is nice.\nOne grad course per quarter covered by SIEPR (excluding summer) taken for a grade.\nWork laptop\nAccess to on campus housing (besides the first summer if you are coming straight from undergrad)\n\nIn practice, this isn’t quite correct; no predocs in my cohort got fall housing on-campus for the fall through Stanford’s lottery. I would say for myself, one of the more stressful parts of the job is getting housing/ moving multiple times within a year and not really knowing that this would happen beforehand.\n\nAccess to on campus amenities like libraries, gym etc.\nMentoring\nPre-doc programming\n20 leave days and 10 holidays. Leave days are not guaranteed but negotiated with professor.\nJ-1 visa sponsorship / OPT eligible (I am not an international predoc, so I know less about how this works in practice)"

The only useful resource I have here is the graduate school advice I looked at to get a sense of what classes I should take now.\n\nSusan Athey’s Advice\nAlvin Christian’s Advice\nFor more grad school specific advice look here.\nThe most helpful places will be looking at the university that you are interested in and seeing if they have information about ‘ideal’ candidates in their application sections. Some are more explicit than others with respect to expected classes etc.\nAlex Albright’s Thesis Advice\n\n\nMy Setup\n\nThings I use everyday\n\nGitHub to implement version control with your code.\n\nI use Tower (included in Student Developer Pack) to make interacting with GitHub less icky.\n\nIf you use Overleaf set up Dropbox integration.\n\nI prefer TexPad (better UI). Can edit documents through Dropbox so it also updates on Overleaf.\n\nZotero for citation management.\nToggl Track to track my time.\nThere’s a lot of value in listening to your essays before you submit them. I use Kurzweil 300 (provided through my college’s disability office) to do so.\nZojirushi Stainless Steel Mug\nBackpack rain cover (any brand).\nGoodNotes (enable some kind of syncing so you don’t risk losing your notes)\nNotion or Obsidian (I oscillate between how much I like either one)\nPrivacy Badger\n1Password\nLibby (app). Borrow free audiobooks from your library! Really nice UI.\n\nPortable ergonomic equipment (good for hand/arm pain)\n\nNextstand (h/t Nic)\nMicrosoft Sculpt or Kyria\nLogitech MX Master 3"
